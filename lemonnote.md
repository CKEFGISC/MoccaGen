## 前端路由

Single Page Application(SPA) ([ref](https://blog.techbridge.cc/2017/09/16/frontend-backend-mvc/))

### Implementation

`useContext`, `useReducer`, `useNavigate` to handle the routing in React, and ensure that we keep track of the current process.

I don't use `react-redux` for now because it might be too heavy for the project.
